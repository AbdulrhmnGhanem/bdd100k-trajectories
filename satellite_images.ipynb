        "## The Approach\n",
        "1. Take the `trajectories_with_timestamps` generated in the [timestamps.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1DACbOOUVDfqEiFVnMmY6b41iIxzZFC-h?usp=sharing).\n",
        "2. Split each trajectory into $50m$ chucks, i.e., each sub-trajectory in the trajectory will include 5 elements from the trajectory array. We want to tolerate trajectories with displacement not a multiple of $50m$ this means sub-trajectories can be at most $50m$ and at least $10m$\n",
        "> $10m \\le sub \\ trajectory \\ length \\le 50m $.\n",
        "3. We will have a problem with the points in which we don't have a GPS location, we need to figure out what algorithm should be used to estimate the GPS location of intermediate sampling points.\n",

        "  * https://www.igismap.com/formula-to-find-bearing-or-heading-angle-between-two-points-latitude-longitude\n",
        "4. If we have the GPS location of all the intermediate sampling points, we can simply call the API to get the satellite images with the parameters we have agreed upon.\n",
